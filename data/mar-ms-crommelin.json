            "This 1:160.000 scale map by Pesce et al. covers the rim and interior of Crommelin crater (Figure 6), an approximately 110 km diameter in western Arabia Terra (PM-MAR-MS-Crommelin_01). It is of special interest  because of the prominent bulging and the well–exposed stratigraphic sequence in its interior made essentially by ELD (equatorial layered deposits). It appears that aeolian erosion has exposed cross-sections through layered units making possible to clearly identify the stratigraphic sequence of the crater infilling units. Indeed, this crater presents a wide variety of geologic-morphologic units, going from a basaltic plateau sequence to layered sequences (where fluid activity was hypothesised, Franchi et al., 2014), impact craters and their ejecta blanket are also visible as well as aeolian-related morphologies (both erosional and depositional) such as mesas, yardangs, dune fields and dust devil tracks.",
